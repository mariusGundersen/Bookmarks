Bookmarks - A QVC & Ordnung.js demo project
===========================================

This is a demo project for [QVC](https://github.com/MariusGundersen/QVC) and 
[Ordnung.js](https://github.com/MariusGundersen/OrdnungJS) built in Java 7 for
Tomcat 7. It is designed to demonstrate all the features of QVC (commands, queries, constraints 
and validation) and Ordnung.js (Knockout.js, Require.js, viewmodel loading, 
proclaim|when and qvc). 

This project has a Maven dependency to [QVC](https://github.com/MariusGundersen/QVC), 
so you need to download and install QVC in your local repository before this will work. 
After that it should be straight forward to run this as a Java servlet.
